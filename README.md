Ever needed an HTML document that holds general information for a team of people consisting of a manager and any number of engineers and interns? Have I got the project for you!

## Project Description

With this command line application you will be able to generate a HTML document after completing a series of command line prompts. Styling has been included to spruce up the look of the document and make it readable on any device. The project uses simple classes to instantiate and encapsulate employee data. As an added bonus, emails entered will be turned into links that will take you to your default email application.

## How to Use

After you have all files included with the project downloaded and assuming you have Node.js installed. Simply run 'npm install' from the base directory to download the necessary dependencies. Once that's finished, all you need to do is type 'node index.js' into the same command line where you will be prompted to start entering information for your team of employees. After all members' information has been entered and you have selected to finish setting up the team a HTML file will be generated with all of the information you entered.

## Testing

A suite of tests is also included with the project to ensure class data has been captured properly from the information entered through the prompts. From the base directory run 'npm test tests' from the command line to see these tests in action.
